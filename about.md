I'm Dan, a Senior Data Scientist at Farfetch. I grew up in Nottingham, UK and currently live in London. I'm very passionate about machine learning and learning new things.

I've previously worked at Deliveroo and at Cytora as a Data Scienist. I graduated with a distinction in MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from UCL. I also studied Computer Science (with Mathematics) at the University of Cambridge as my undergraduate degree. Before deciding to pursue Data Science, I worked in Sales &amp; Trading at Bank of America Merrill Lynch for a couple of years.

In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton, football, music, writing generic autobiographies, and complaining about London transport.
